```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##introduction
This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state).

We are going to use the following library:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data we already wrangled:
```{r}
load("C:/Users/Citi User/projects/murders/rda/murders.rda")
```
## Murder rate by state 


```{r echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate( abb=reorder(abb,rate)) %>% ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) + geom_bar(width =0.5,stat= "identity") + coord_flip()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
